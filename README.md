# work-planner
## Day by day work scheduler

## Description
Planner to organise my work day by the hour. I found myself with bits of paper lying around and losing track of where I was up to whilst 
working. I rectified this problem by creating a work planner to keep myself more organised and pro active during my day. 
I have colour coded the time blocks orange for past, red for the present and green for future so at a glance I can see what urgently needs attending to and what needs to be done later in the day.
